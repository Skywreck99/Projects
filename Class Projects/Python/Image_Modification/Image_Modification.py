# Part 1: Inversion
#==========================================
# Purpose:
#   Inverts the colors of an image
# Input Parameter(s):
#   A 3D matrix (list of lists of lists) representing an .bmp image
#   Each element of the matrix represents one row of pixels in the image
#   Each element of a row represents a single pixel in the image
#   Each pixel is represented by a list of three numbers between 0 and 255
#   in the order [blue, green, red]
# Return Value:
#   A 3D matrix of the same dimensions, with all colors inverted
#   (that is, for every value x in the input matrix, the output matrix
#   should have 255-x in that spot).
#==========================================
def invert(img_matrix):
    for i in img_matrix:
        for j in i:
            for k in j:
                for l in range(3):
                    j[l] = 255-k
    return img_matrix

# Part 2: Grayscale
#==========================================
# Purpose:
#   Converts an image to grayscale
# Input Parameter(s):
#   A 3D image matrix (see part 1)
# Return Value:
#   A 3D matrix of the same dimensions, where each pixel has all components
#   (red, green, blue) set to the average of the three components in the
#   original pixel, rounded down if necessary
#==========================================
def grayscale(img_matrix):
    for i in img_matrix:
        for j in i:
            ave = (j[0]+j[1]+j[2])//3
            for l in range(3):
                j[l] = ave
    return img_matrix

# Part 3: Rotate 180 degrees
#==========================================
# Purpose:
#   Rotates an image 180 degrees (equivalent to flipping on both axes)
# Input Parameter(s):
#   A 3D image matrix (see part 1)
# Return Value:
#   A 3D matrix of the same dimensions, rotated 180 degrees.  This means
#   that a pixel at location (x,y) in the original matrix should end up
#   at location (width-x-1,height-y-1) in the output matrix, assuming that
#   we start counting at 0.
#==========================================
def rotate(img_matrix):
    img_matrix.reverse()
    return img_matrix

#==========================================
# Purpose:
#   Compute the integer represented by a sequence of bytes
# Input Parameter(s):
#   A list of bytes (integers between 0 and 255), in big-endian order
# Return Value:
#   Integer value that the bytes represent
#==========================================
def big_end_to_int(ls):
    total = 0
    for ele in ls[::-1]:
        total *= 256
        total += ele
    return total

# .bmp conversion function (Taylor Implementation)
#==========================================
# Purpose:
#   Turns a .bmp file into a matrix of pixel values, performs an operation
#   on it, and then converts it back into a new .bmp file
# Input Parameter(s):
#   fname, a string representing a file name in the current directory
#   operation, a string representing the operation to be performed on the
#   image.  This can be one of 4 options: 'invert', 'grayscale', 'rotate',
#   or 'edge_detect'.
# Return Value:
#   None
#==========================================
